## About project

This is a simple password complexity checker app. However, it is noteworthy that I used Reactive Forms and also optimized it with RxJS.

This application was a good practice for creating custom validation as well as streamlining application form input.

In the future, perhaps, the function of saving and displaying user-created combinations on the page will be added.
